# Neighborly

Your community's helping hand. A platform for neighbors to trade small favors and services, strengthening local bonds.

## Project Description

Neighborly is a mobile-first platform designed to foster a strong sense of community by creating a simple, trustworthy marketplace for non-monetary task exchange. It allows users within a verified geographical neighborhood to post tasks they need help with (e.g., watering plants, carrying groceries, simple tech support) and for other neighbors to offer their help, earning 'community credits' or karma in return.

## Target Audience

Residents of specific neighborhoods, apartment complexes, or localized communities who are looking to build trust and mutual support with their neighbors.

## Core Functionality

### User Authentication
*   Secure user registration and profile management.
*   Email/Password and Social (Google/Apple) signup/login.
*   Profile creation: Name, Photo, Short Bio, Skills/Interests.
*   Neighborhood Verification: A mechanism to ensure users live in the specified community (e.g., address verification, community code, or moderator approval).

### Task Management
*   The complete lifecycle of a task from request to completion.
*   Create Task: User posts a request with a title, detailed description, category (e.g., 'Manual Help', 'Pet Care', 'Tech Support'), and urgency level.
*   Browse Tasks: A filterable list or map view of open tasks within the user's neighborhood.
*   Offer to Help: Users can 'claim' or 'offer help' on a task.
*   Task Status Tracking: Clear statuses like 'Open', 'In Progress', 'Completed', 'Cancelled'.
*   Task Requester confirms completion.

### Exchange System
*   A non-monetary system to encourage reciprocity and fairness.
*   Community Credits (or 'Karma Points'): Users get a starting balance.
*   Spending Credits: Posting a new task costs a small number of credits.
*   Earning Credits: Users earn credits by successfully completing a task for a neighbor.
*   Gifting Credits: Ability for users to send credits to others as a 'thank you'.

### Communication
*   Secure, in-app messaging to protect user privacy.
*   Private messaging between the task requester and the person offering help.
*   Contextual chats linked to specific tasks.
*   Push notifications for new messages.

### Trust and Safety
*   Features to build confidence and ensure a safe environment.
*   Two-way Ratings & Reviews: Both parties rate each other after a task is completed.
*   Public Profile with task history and average rating.
*   Reporting System: Ability to flag inappropriate content or user behavior.
*   Community Vouching: A system where existing members can vouch for new ones.

### Notifications
*   Timely alerts to keep users engaged.
*   Push notifications for new tasks in their category of interest, messages, offers on their tasks, and task status changes.

## UI/UX Guidelines

*   **Theme**: Friendly, approachable, clean, and trustworthy.
*   **Color Palette**: Suggest warm and inviting colors (e.g., soft greens, blues, oranges).
*   **User Experience**: Intuitive and simple workflow, minimizing the number of clicks to post or find a task. The interface should feel like a community noticeboard, not a corporate application.

## Technology Stack Suggestion

*   **Mobile App**: React Native or Flutter (for cross-platform iOS/Android support).
*   **Backend**: Node.js (Express/NestJS) or Python (Django/FastAPI).
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for potential location-based features.
*   **Realtime**: WebSockets (e.g., Socket.io) for the chat functionality.
*   **Deployment**: Cloud-based service like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalability.

## Success Metrics

### Engagement
*   Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)
*   Number of tasks created per week
*   Number of tasks completed per week

### Community
*   Average user rating
*   Growth rate of verified users within a community

### Retention
*   Percentage of users who complete a task and go on to post a task (and vice-versa)
*   User churn rate
